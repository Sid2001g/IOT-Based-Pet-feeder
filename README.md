IoT-Based Pet Feeder
Overview
The IoT-Based Pet Feeder is a smart device that enables you to feed your pet remotely from anywhere with an internet connection. Leveraging the power of Arduino, ESP8266, and Adafruit IO, this pet feeder provides real-time monitoring, scheduling, and interactive features to ensure your pet is well-fed even when you're away.

Technologies Used
Arduino: Microcontroller platform for hardware control and interfacing.
ESP8266: WiFi module for wireless communication and IoT connectivity.
Adafruit IO: Cloud-based service for MQTT communication and data exchange.
Servo Motor: Controls the opening and closing of the pet feeder door.
NTPClient: Library for accurate time synchronization over the internet.
OLED Display: Displaying real-time information and status updates.
WiFiUdp: UDP library for WiFi communication.
ThingSpeak: Cloud platform for storing and analyzing real-time data.
Features
Remote Feeding: Feed your pet remotely from anywhere with an internet connection.
Real-Time Monitoring: Monitor the pet feeder status and activities in real-time.
Scheduled Feeding: Set specific feeding schedules for different times of the day.
Interactive UI: User-friendly OLED display for easy interaction and status visualization.
Feedback Sound: Audible feedback through a sound indicator when feeding is initiated.
Adaptive Feed Time: Dynamically adjust feeding time based on user preferences.
